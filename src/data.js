        para1: `Buterin was born in Kolomna, Russia, to Dmitry Buterin, a computer scientist,[8] and Natalia Ameline (née Chistyakova). He lived in the area until the age of six when his parents emigrated to Canada in search of better employment opportunities.[9] While in grade three of elementary school in Canada, Buterin was placed into a class for gifted children and was drawn to mathematics, programming, and economics.[10] Buterin then attended the Abelard School, a private high school in Toronto.[11] Buterin learned about Bitcoin, from his father, at the age of 17.[9]

        After high school, Buterin attended the University of Waterloo. There, he took advanced courses and was a research assistant for cryptographer Ian Goldberg, who co-created Off-the-Record Messaging and was the former board of directors chairman of the Tor Project.[12][13] In 2012, he won a bronze medal in the International Olympiad in Informatics.[14]
        
        In 2013, he visited developers in other countries who shared his enthusiasm for code. He returned to Toronto later that year and published a white paper proposing Ethereum.[15] He dropped out of university in 2014 when he was awarded with a grant of $100,000 from the Thiel Fellowship, a scholarship created by venture capitalist Peter Thiel and went to work on Ethereum full-time.[16]
        
        On 25 June 2017, Buterin was the subject of a death hoax originating from 4chan.[17] On 30 November 2018, Buterin received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Basel on the occasion of the Dies Academicus.[18]bbjj`,
        para2: `In 2011, Buterin began writing for a publication called Bitcoin Weekly after meeting a person on a bitcoin forum in order to earn bitcoin.[19] The owner offered five bitcoin (about $3.50 at the time) to anyone who would write an article for him.[20] Buterin wrote for the site until its website shut down soon thereafter due to insufficient revenue.[21] In September 2011, Mihai Alisie reached out to Buterin about starting a new print publication called Bitcoin Magazine, a position which Buterin would accept as the first co-founder, and contribute to as a leading writer.[19]

        Bitcoin Magazine in 2012 later began publishing a print edition and has been referred to as the first serious publication dedicated to cryptocurrencies.[22] While working for Bitcoin Magazine, Buterin reached out to Jed McCaleb for a job at Ripple who accepted.[23] However, their proposed employment fell apart after Ripple was unable to support a U.S. visa for Buterin.[23]
        
        In addition, he held a position on the editorial board of Ledger in 2016, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes full-length original research articles on the subjects of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.[24][needs update]`
